# Stock_Analysis
Stock Market Analysis Project
Overview
This project involves an analysis of trends in the stock market, focusing on volume changes and percentage price changes across various sectors. The analysis was conducted using Python and Jupyter Notebook for data extraction and cleaning, followed by data visualization and exploration using Tableau.

Project Highlights
Data Extraction and Preprocessing
Data was collected from yfinance using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
Data was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
Companies were assigned to their respective sectors.
Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix was computed to understand the dependencies between different sectors in the stock market.
Key findings from the correlation matrix include:
Telecommunication has minimal impact on other sectors.
Cement and banking sectors exhibit the highest dependency.
Volume and Price Trends
Visualizations were created to depict trends in volume change and percentage price change for each sector.
Patterns and insights were highlighted based on the visualizations.
Quarterly Analysis
Analysis of trading volume throughout the year revealed that most trades occurred during the last quarter.
This was supported by the observation of the maximum change in volume in the fourth quarter.
Inverse Relationships
The concept of inverse relationships between sectors, such as gold being inversely related to the stock market, was explored.
Visual evidence of these inverse relationships was provided.
COVID-19 Impact
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors was analyzed.
Findings included:
The energy sector experienced significant losses.
Banking and finance sectors were among the hardest-hit.
The pharma sector showed resilience and even growth during the pandemic.
Sector Relationships
The project highlighted that certain sectors tend to follow the trends of others.
This observation was supported by visualizations created in Tableau.
Project Visualization
The visualizations and interactive dashboards created for this project can be explored in detail on Tableau. You can access the Tableau workbook here.
